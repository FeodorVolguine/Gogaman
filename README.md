## Gogaman

Gogaman is a realtime 3D rendering engine.

### Features
#### Note: Rendering features not currently integrated in master branch to simplify shader language compiler development. Consider examining older commits instead.

- Vulkan rendering backend
- Temporal anti-aliasing
- Voxel cone-traced global illumination
- Rendering dependency graph scheduling system
- Physically-based shading and camera
- Custom asset/scene binary format
- Post-processing effects such as: bloom, ACES filmic tonemapping, film grain, and circular separable convolution depth of field
- UNDER DEVELOPMENT: Custom shader language (transpiles to SPIR-V)
